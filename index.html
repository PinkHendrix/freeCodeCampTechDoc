        Bodysurfing is the art and sport of riding waves without the assistance of any buoyant device or object such as a surfboard or a bodyboard.  Depending on the depth of water, swimfins are recommended.  If you are able to touch the bottom and can push off of it to catch a wave then fins aren't needed.  But if going any deeper or with strong currents, then it is preferable and recommended to wear swimfins for added propulsion.

        How to swim.  Seriously, you should be very comfortable swimming in the ocean and familiar with currents, rip tides, et cetera.  A surfboard or boogieboard are 'false' flotation devices in that you can lose them at any time.  The ocean will rip things out of your hands and body, leashes snap, boards break all the time.  Hence why before knowing how to surf, you should learn to bodysurf.  And prior to bodysurfing you should be a very proficient swimmer.  The ocean demands respect, sometimes currents are so strong that even a friend or lifeguard won't be able to reach you to assist you in time, so...be a good swimmer.  Now don't let that scare you off, start out in a pool and then move to the ocean when the waves and currents aren't as big or strong.  Learn how to read currents, swell, tides and wind.  Now, let's get into the fun stuff.
