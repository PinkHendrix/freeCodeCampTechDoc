Technical Documentation re: BodySurfing

A project for freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design course.

I love being in the Ocean and BodySurfing is the first thing I tell people they should learn before going out and buying a Surfboard to learn to Surf.

For the details why, please go check out the actual Documentation in here.

So how with coding most people recommend starting out with the likes of Python or JS, et cetera before tackling C, C# or Java.  Before Surfing, I definitely recommend BodySurfing.

BodySurfing is still a powerful experience that you will be able to enjoy long after learning to Surf with a board, when the waves are closing out I usually ditch the board and just enjoy BodySurfing.  

So akin to Python, BodySurfing is great for the novice as well as the advanced learner.

Cheers and Go Surf!
